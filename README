This project is an attempt to make some of the pointer schemes defined by the TEI Guidelines (http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html) 
usable by implementing complementary functions in XSLT 2.0.  The tests in the XSLT are meant to be run on the XML file bgu.1.166.xml, which is taken from the 
Integrating Digital Papyrology repository (http://halsted.vis.uky.edu/gitweb?p=idp.data.git;a=tree).
